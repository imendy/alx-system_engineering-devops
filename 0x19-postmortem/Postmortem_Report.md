# Postmortem: Web Stack Outage Incident

## Issue Summary:

**Duration:**
- Start Time: 2023-11-10 14:00 UTC
- End Time: 2023-11-10 16:30 UTC

**Impact:**
- The authentication service experienced downtime, affecting 30% of users.
- Users were unable to log in, leading to disruptions in accessing critical functionalities.

**Root Cause:**
- Database connection pool exhaustion due to a spike in concurrent user requests.

## Timeline:

- **14:00 UTC: Issue Detected**
  - An influx of error alerts from the authentication service triggered monitoring systems.
- **14:05 UTC: Investigation Initiated**
  - The engineering team started investigating potential causes, focusing on recent code deployments.
- **14:20 UTC: Misleading Paths**
  - Initial assumption pointed to a faulty deployment, leading to unnecessary rollbacks.
- **14:40 UTC: Escalation**
  - With no improvement, the incident was escalated to the database team to investigate potential database-related issues.
- **15:00 UTC: Database Investigation**
  - The database team identified high connection counts, leading to the discovery of connection leaks.
- **15:30 UTC: Corrective Measures**
  - Database connections were optimized, and a fix was deployed to address the connection leak.
- **16:00 UTC: Service Restoration**
  - The authentication service was gradually restored, and users regained access.
- **16:30 UTC: Incident Resolved**
  - Monitoring systems reported stable service metrics, marking the official end of the incident.

## Root Cause and Resolution:

**Root Cause:**
- Database connection pool exhaustion due to connection leaks, causing the authentication service to become unresponsive.

**Resolution:**
- Optimized database connections and deployed a fix to address the connection leak.
- Implemented safeguards to prevent future connection pool exhaustion.

## Corrective and Preventative Measures:

**Improvements/Fixes:**
- Enhance monitoring for early detection of connection pool issues.
- Conduct regular code reviews to identify and rectify potential connection leaks.
- Implement automated testing to simulate and detect scenarios leading to connection pool exhaustion.
- Conduct a comprehensive review of the overall system architecture to identify areas for optimization.

**Tasks:**
- Add additional logging to track connection usage and identify potential leaks.
- Update documentation to include best practices for database connection management.
- Conduct a post-incident review with the engineering team to identify lessons learned and areas for improvement.
- Schedule regular training sessions on incident response procedures and troubleshooting techniques.

## Conclusion:

The web stack outage incident was primarily attributed to database connection pool exhaustion caused by connection leaks. Swift identification, collaboration across teams, and targeted corrective measures ensured a timely resolution. The outlined corrective and preventative measures aim to fortify the system against similar incidents in the future, fostering a resilient and reliable web stack.
