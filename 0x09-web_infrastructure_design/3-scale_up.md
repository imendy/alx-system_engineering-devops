## Readme: Application Server vs. Web Server

In this setup, we have designed an infrastructure that separates the roles of the web server and the application server for improved scalability, performance, and manageability. A load balancer (HAproxy) is used to distribute incoming traffic across multiple application servers, providing redundancy and efficient resource utilization.

Infrastructure Components:

Load Balancer (HAproxy):

Role: Distributes incoming traffic to multiple application servers.
Explanation: The load balancer ensures even distribution of user requests among multiple application servers, improving responsiveness and providing fault tolerance.
Web Server:

Role: Serves static content and handles initial request processing.
Explanation: The web server (e.g., Nginx) efficiently serves static files like images, stylesheets, and scripts. It handles the initial HTTP requests and forwards dynamic requests to the application server.
Application Server:

Role: Processes dynamic content, executes application logic.
Explanation: The application server hosts the application codebase and processes dynamic requests. It communicates with the database, performs computations, and generates dynamic content to be sent back to the user.
Database Server:

Role: Stores and manages application data.
Explanation: The database server (e.g., MySQL) stores the application's data, such as user accounts, posts, and other relevant information.
Additional Elements and Explanations:

1. Application Server Separation:
By splitting the application server from the web server, we achieve better resource utilization. The application server can focus solely on processing dynamic requests without being burdened by serving static files.

2. Load Balancer Cluster:
The load balancer is configured as a cluster with redundancy to ensure high availability. If one load balancer fails, the other can take over, minimizing downtime and providing fault tolerance.

## Reasons for Adding Elements:

Load Balancer: A load balancer optimizes resource usage, enhances fault tolerance, and improves the overall user experience by distributing traffic evenly.

Web Server: Separating static content serving from dynamic content processing offloads the application server, optimizing performance and response times.

Application Server: Hosting the application logic and processing dynamic content on a separate server improves scalability and allows efficient resource allocation.

Database Server: Storing data on a dedicated server enables efficient data management, backup, and retrieval.

This infrastructure design allows for better resource utilization, easier scalability, and enhanced reliability by distributing roles and responsibilities across different servers.
